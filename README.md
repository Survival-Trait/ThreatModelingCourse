# Threat Modeling Foundations (L1)

**Module Code:** TM-L1-001  
**Level:** Foundation  
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours (self-paced)

## 📋 Course Description

Learn to identify and prioritize security risks before they become incidents. This foundation module teaches a minimal viable threat modeling workflow for small teams, solo builders, and early-career defenders. No expensive tools or certifications required—just structured thinking that produces actionable results.

You'll learn to scope systems, identify threats using STRIDE, prioritize risks with simple impact/likelihood analysis, and create action plans that actually get implemented. The course includes a real CI/CD pipeline lab exercise and reusable templates for your own systems.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this course, you will be able to:

1. **Decide** what parts of a system need security attention first
2. **Explain** why a specific threat matters more than others in your context
3. **Produce** a threat table that maps risks to owners and controls
4. **Justify** security recommendations using impact and likelihood reasoning
5. **Document** threat model findings in a way that non-security stakeholders understand

## 📚 Course Structure

### Lessons

1. [What Threat Modeling Actually Does](lesson_1_what_threat_modeling_does.md)
2. [Define the System and Draw Boundaries](lesson_2_define_system_boundaries.md)
3. [Identify Threats Using STRIDE](lesson_3_identify_threats_stride.md)
4. [Prioritize Using Impact and Likelihood](lesson_4_prioritize_impact_likelihood.md)
5. [Map Controls and Owners](lesson_5_map_controls_owners.md)

### Practical Work

- [Lab Exercise: Threat Model a CI/CD Pipeline](lab_cicd_pipeline.md)
- [Student Workbook with Templates](workbook_threat_modeling.md)

### Assessment

- [Final Quiz (12 Questions)](quiz_threat_modeling.md)

## ✅ Success Criteria

You've successfully completed this module when you can:

- Take an unfamiliar system description and produce a threat table in under 2 hours
- Explain your top 3 threats to someone outside security
- Identify at least one control owner for each high-priority threat
- Produce evidence criteria that show when a control is working

## 🎓 Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of IT systems and security concepts
- No prior threat modeling experience required

## 📖 How to Use This Course

1. **Work through lessons sequentially** (1-5)
2. **Complete the lab exercise** after Lesson 5
3. **Use the workbook** for your own systems alongside the lessons
4. **Take the quiz** to validate your understanding
5. **Apply the workflow** to a real system in your environment

## 🔄 Next Steps After Completion

- **Recommended:** Security Controls Implementation (L1)
- **Alternative:** Incident Response Fundamentals (L1)
- **Advanced:** Threat Modeling for Cloud Systems (L2)
